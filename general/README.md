# General Guidelines

## Principles

- Don't try to reinvent the wheel, use and contribute to the open source
- Code is read much more often than it is written, exercising clean code matters to us
- Refactoring and unit testing is part of the job, do it when needed
- Optimize code for people first, beware of premature optimization
- Use tools to enforce code style and good practices
- Clean up unused code and don't design ahead
- Keep documentation close to the code. Best documentation is a good name
- Stick to the best practices and follow proven software principles (KISS, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, ...)
