# Testing Guidelines

## General

- Code coverage is easy to measure but real test quality is more complicated than that, write test where it matters
- Writing unit tests is automatically considered to be a part of the developer's job
- Manual feature testing is executed by the developer and should be also performed by the code reviewer
- Other guidelines in this repo also apply to the code produced during testing
